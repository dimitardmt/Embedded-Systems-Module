# Embedded-Systems-Module
Project done as an university assessment on the STM32F4Discovery board. Using the accelerometere reading and the 4 LEDs at the top of the board to show ,which way the board is inclined. 
It uses 2 threads. One to display the tilt inclination using the front 4 LEDs and one to hold the former after the user button has been pressed. The interrupts are done using NVIC. 
The project has been slightly updated from the feedback provided.
